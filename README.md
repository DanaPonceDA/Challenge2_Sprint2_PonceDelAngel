This project is for Sprint 2 of "Back End in Java for Information Processing."

The project is to convert JSON files to CSV.

For this project to work, you must add or change the new fields that will be converted from the JSON file in the User class.

I added three fields: "name" (String), "age" (Integer), and "gender" (String).
